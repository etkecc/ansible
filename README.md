It's a wrapper around awesome [spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) playbook
with additional tasks, like system Maintenance.

Please, read the [spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) documentation,
because matrix-ansible repo is only a wrapper around it, so 99% of work done in Slavi's repo.
