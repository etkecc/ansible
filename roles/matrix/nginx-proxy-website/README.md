# matrix/nginx-proxy-website

That role deploys your website to your matrix's base domain.

## Requirements

1. Put following in your matrix host's vars.yml file:

```yml
matrix_nginx_proxy_base_domain_homepage_enabled: false
matrix_nginx_proxy_website_enabled: true
```

it will disable `Hello from DOMAIN!` index.html file automatically generated by matrix-nginx-proxy role
and allow you to put any content you want to website folder

2. You should have git (and website builder, if you use it) installed control/host machine where you run that role

### matrix_nginx_proxy_website_dist
